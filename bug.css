The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue where a pseudo-element is unexpectedly overriding a class style due to specificity rules:

```css
.element {
  color: blue;
}

.element::before {
  content: "prefix ";
  color: red;
}

.element.special {
  color: green;
}
```

In this scenario, applying the `.special` class to the element will not result in a green text color as expected. The `::before` pseudo-element's more specific selector overrides the `color` property set by `.element.special`.  This is counter-intuitive to how many developers expect specificity to work, as the class selector is normally more specific than a pseudo-element selector in this situation.
